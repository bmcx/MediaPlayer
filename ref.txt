bug: clicking on progress slider doesn't move head clicked position
bug: sometimes the audio duration returned from the slot 'durationChanged' and 'positionChanged' is larger than the actual length of the audio.
bug: QVideoWidget's fullscreen state will open another window and the current window won't have focus so keybinds wouldn't work to leave from fullscreen mode.
